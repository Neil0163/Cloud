Ping is a way of testing a connection from one client ot another

To do this we open the terminal and use ping (ip address)
for example ping 192.168.7.1 
you will see packets of data being sent and recived 
if there are any packets lost youll see this aswell. 

ping -f < send huge amounts of packets, you  shouldnt use this>

ping -o < sends one single packet>

ping -a < when pinging sounds an audiable tone>
