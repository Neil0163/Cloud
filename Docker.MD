****************How do you run a container in the background?**********************

To run a Docker container in the background, you can use the -d flag when running the container
example: docker run -d < image_name> 
To run a specific port you can use -p flag
Example:
        docker run -d -p 8080:80
        You can use docker ps command to view running containers.

***************How do you stop a container running in the background?**********************

To stop a container running in the backgroud we can use stop 
Example:
        docker stop < container_id_or_name > 
        alternativley you can use docker kill < container_id_or_name > to forcefully stop the container without cleaning it up.

*****************How can you make files outside of the container accessible inside the container?*****************

You can use Bind Mounts, with bind mounts you can mpa a directory or file from the host machine to a dir inside the container, 
this allows the container to access and modify the files outside of its isolated file system
example: docjer run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container < image_name>

Shared between multiple containers
Docker Volumes: Docker Volumes are a Docker-managed storage location tht can be shared between container restarts, 
by creating a volume and attaching it to a container, you can make files accessible inside the container. 
Example: docker volume create my_volume 
         docker run -v my_volume:/path/in/container < image_name> 

******************How can you persist files within a Docker container?*************************

Volumes: Docker volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes exist outside of the container's Union File System and persist even after the container is stopped or deleted. You can create a volume and mount it into a container using the -v or --mount flag when running a container.

Example: 
        # Create a named volume
        docker volume create my_volume

        # Run a container and mount the volume
        docker run -v my_volume:/path/in/container my_image

Bind Mounts: Bind mounts link a directory on the host to a directory in the container, allowing you to persist data on the host machine. Changes made on either end are reflected in real-time. Use the -v or --mount flag to create a bind mount.
Example: 
        # Mount a host directory into a container
        docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my_image

******************Various Docker containers*****************************************

Machine Learning / AI Frameworks: Containers can encapsulate machine learning and AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and others. These containers often come pre-configured with the necessary dependencies and libraries for easy deployment and scaling of machine learning models.

Data Processing Tools: Containers can be used to run data processing tools like Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Kafka, and Hadoop. These containers simplify the setup and deployment of distributed data processing tasks.

DevOps Tools: Various DevOps tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD Runners, Ansible, and Prometheus can be containerized to facilitate continuous integration, continuous deployment, and monitoring in a consistent environment.

Networking Utilities: Containers can be used to run networking utilities such as Wireshark, Nmap, or tools for VPNs or proxies, allowing easier management and deployment of network-related functionalities.

Security Tools: Security-related applications like intrusion detection systems (IDS), security scanning tools, vulnerability assessment tools, and firewalls can be containerized for easier deployment and integration within different environments.

Content Management Systems (CMS): Containers can encapsulate CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla, making it easy to create, deploy, and maintain websites or blogs with consistent configurations.

IoT Applications: Containers can house applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT), managing and deploying IoT services, edge computing solutions, or MQTT brokers for handling IoT communication.

Desktop Applications: Although less common, containers can encapsulate desktop applications, allowing users to run applications like web browsers, office suites, or design tools in a containerized environment for consistency and security.

Scientific Computing: Containers can package scientific computing software such as Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, or scientific Python environments tailored for data analysis, visualization, and simulation tasks.
