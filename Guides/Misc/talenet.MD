**********Telnet************

Telnet establishes a connection to a remote server. In a sense, it is pretending that there is a dedicated cable connecting the two computers.

However, unlike in a circuit switched phone network, this connection is not real. It is a virtual connection. We'll see how packets are used to create this virtual connection using termshark.
